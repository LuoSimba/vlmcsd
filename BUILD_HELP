    CAT=1                        Combine all sources in a single in-memory file and compile directly to target.
    NOPROCFS=1                   Don't rely on a properly mounted proc filesystem in /proc.
    AUXV=1                       Use /proc/self/auxv (requires Linux with glibc >= 2.16 or musl.)
    NOLPTHREAD=1                 Disable detection if -lpthread is required (for use with Android NDK).
    NOLRESOLV=1                  Disable detection if -lresolv is required  (for use with Android NDK).

    NO_TIMEOUT=1                 Do not set timeouts for sockets (for systems that don't support it).
    CHILD_HANDLER=1              Install a handler for SIGCHLD (for systems that don't support SA_NOCLDWAIT).

    NO_GETIFADDRS=1              Compile vlmcsd without using getifaddrs().
    GETIFADDRS=musl              Compile vlmcsd with its own implementation of getifaddrs() based on musl.
    DNS_PARSER=internal          Use vlmcs internal DNS parsing routines. No effect on MingW (native Windows).
